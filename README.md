This perfect starter kit is an app based on React Native and [**UI Kitten library**][link:ui-kitten] with Light and Dark themes support. It’s completely free and Open Source. 
Compose the application from available screens, add backend integration and you will end up with A-grade cross-platform mobile application.
The themes can be changed in the runtime, without any need of reloading the application.

Download a live Demo published on both [App Store][link:app-store] and [Google Play][link:google-play]
 or simply run it yourself by cloning a GitHub repo.
